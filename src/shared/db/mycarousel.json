It doesn’t look like any current generation rocket by any shape or measure. It’s shorter and bulkier than any typical rocket. Most surprising of all; it’s made out of Stainless Steel. Stainless Steels have been forgotten since the 1960’s for making propellant tanks as seen in the famous Atlas rockets. Then why does Elon want to use it.",
